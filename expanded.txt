how many species of frogs are there
Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforests.
----------
frogs usually live in aquatic environments
This makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in the environment, some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in the water film and be passed into their bloodstream.
----------
frogs like to jump on lily pads
Arboreal frogs have pads located on the ends of their toes to help grip vertical surfaces.
----------
frogs have a really long tongue that can eat insects
 When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended.
