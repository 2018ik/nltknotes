# nltknotes
Uses natural language tool kit and basic web scraping to find Wikipedia sentences that have the closest semantic meaning to user generated phrases, effectively "expanding" notes (albeit badly).

How to use:

Notes should be typed in notes.txt, which each phrase separated by a new line

The program takes an input of a website, preferably one with a lot of informational sentences like Wikipedia. For instance in the included example I used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog

expanded.txt will contain the "expanded" notes
